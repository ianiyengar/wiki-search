## Wiki-Search - About

I created the Wiki-search project using React. I originally learned Vue.js so this was fun for me to work with something different. I integrated the Wikipedia API so that the user can type in anything into the search box to find relevant Wikipedia articles. There is also a button to generate a randomized search for anyone that wants to be surprised! Each topic has a text preview and the user can click “Read More” to be directed to the Wikipedia page. The app also tells you how many search results were found and displays the top 50 results.

The React app was already functioning as needed and met all necessary requirements without the need for a backend, so there was no need to incorporate a Ruby on Rails backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
